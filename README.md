# USRCAT

This C++ implementation of USRCAT provides all required basic functionality to perform ligand based virtual screening and database searching.

Written in C++14 and relying on OpenBabel for molecular manipulation, this code is mostly contained in the single header hpp file Usrcat.hpp.  The Usrcat.cpp provides a full program implementation including reading molecules from SDF files.

Built and tested using clang 3.8.0.
